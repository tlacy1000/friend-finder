# Friend-finder
Friend-finder is an app that matches friends via compatibility survey using node and express. A user answers ten questions based on big 5 personality psychology and is matched with a teen titan who they would get along with well based on reverse scoring and complementary trait matching. The question format utilizes a likert scale with response options ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
